# playground-nodejs-1
My programming playground #1 where I am mostly trying stuff and prototyping things regarding nodejs

## What am I testing in this repository?

Mainly node.js and Express stuff and, more precisely:

- pre-commit hooks by using https://github.com/observing/pre-commit/
- cookies integration with Express.js
  - https://github.com/pillarjs/cookies
- Express.js unit/integration testing by using
  - mocha, chai-http
- Coverage with istanbul
  - I have output a cobertura report because I wanted to test it with a local installation of Jenkins 2 (which is working nicely, by the way)
